# Portfolio Challenge 

## Project Notes

The project was to create a portfolio page that contains a header, a portfolio, links to future projects, and an about me section. This project was built using CSS and HTML. 
CSS configuration gave me the most trouble. I learned that defining space on a webpage is very important, and the use of flexbox is a compliment to strong layout design, but does not replace it. 
I wanted the articles to be clickable and to expand when pressed. I achieved that, but I lost the ability to easily create a distinction using an opacate background and clear fonts. I will have to come back to this in the future.
Other future improvements will be better spacing of the projects as well as a description of the project and a screen shot as the button background image. Style wise, I appreceiated the 
ability to create a hero section where the background image scrolls as well as logo instead of text in the header. One improvement to make to the header is to give it more dimension. 
I would like to have the logo encrouch onto the hero section so the two are more tied together.
